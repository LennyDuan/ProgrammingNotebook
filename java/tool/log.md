Log output is always one of the most important thing in a Java project. Try to use log4j, commons logging, java.util.logging and etc before but they all have their own disadvantages. Here I wanna introduce a very _simple-use_, _powerful_, and ___Elegant___ logging tool - __SLF4j__:

### SLF4J 
The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time - [sfl4j doc](https://www.slf4j.org).
