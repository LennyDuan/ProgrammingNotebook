# Collection Operation

Here will talk about the how to quick operate/modify the collection (__Array or Objects__) via _build-in_ & _elegant_ ES6 features. 

There have lots of third-party API/Modules about operate the Array such as [Lodash](https://lodash.com), [Underscores](http://underscorejs.org) _(WTF! Can anyone tell me why they all start with_ __\_.__?) and etc to help developer to operate the collections. But here, I  wanna talk about ___build-in ES6+___ Collection operation which have 90% coverage of normally usages. 

More info can be checked in [official doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
