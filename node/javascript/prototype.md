# JavaScript Object Prototypes

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not provide a class implementationï¼ˆthe class keyword is introduced in ES2015, but is syntactical sugar, JavaScript remains __prototype-based__).

For example: Date objects inherit from Date.prototype. Array objects inherit from Array.prototype. Person objects inherit from Person.prototype. The __Object.prototype__ is on the __top__ of the prototype inheritance chain: Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

### Adding Properties and Methods to Objects
* Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to all existing objects of a given type.

* Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to an object constructor.

* Object.prototype.\_\_proto\_\_: The `__proto__` property of Object.prototype is an accessor property (a getter function and a setter function) that exposes the internal [[Prototype]] (either an object or null) of the object through which it is accessed. 
__NOTICE__: The use of `__proto__` is controversial, and has been discouraged.
