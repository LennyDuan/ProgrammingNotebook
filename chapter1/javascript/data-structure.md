# Data Structure

Here will talk about the how to implement different data structure in JavaScript.

### Queue


### Stack
A stack follows the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) paradigm: an item added last will be removed first. JavaScript have a _buid-in stack_ via array - use Array to implement basic stack function. The __Array class__ has 2 methods that provide stack functionality. _.push()_ appends an item to the end of the array, and _.pop()_ removes and returns the last item in the array. 

```
var stack = [];
stack.push(1);     
stack.push(2);     
stack.push(3);      
var i = stack.pop(); 
alert(i);            
```

### LinkedList
